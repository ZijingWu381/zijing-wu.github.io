**Starting in Fall 2024**, I will begin my PhD study in Computational Neuroscience with [Dr. Paul Masset](https://scholar.harvard.edu/paul-masset). I 
am excited for the journey laid ahead of us to march on.

I study Math, Computer Science, and Psychology at Georgia Tech, with a general focus on understanding the brain with computational approaches.
Currently, I am a Guest Researcher at the [Center for Computational Neuroscience](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-neuroscience/) at [Simons Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/). I remotely continue my summer work with [Dr. SueYeon Chung](https://sites.google.com/site/sueyeonchung/) and [Dr. Jenelle Feather](https://www.jenellefeather.com/) on studying the role of stochasticity in both ventral visual stream and its computational models, vision ANN's. Back at Georgia Tech, I work with [Prof. Anqi Wu](https://sites.google.com/view/brainml/home?authuser=0) on using generative probabilistic models for neural latent discovery/alignment. Previously, I have been very fortunate to work in [Prof. Eva Dyer](https://dyerlab.gatech.edu/)'s group on topics also lie in the intersection of machine learning and neuroscience. 

Apart from academic life, I enjoy [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/96906289-zijing), playing table tennis and soccer, and listening to classical music and jazz.

## Research Interests
My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning, neuroscience, and psychology. The recurrent themes of my past and current research are interpretable neural latent representation, neural manifold geometry, and neural stochasticity. My scientific curiosity originates and persists from a passion for understanding the computational mechanism of the brain - in all modalities and regions, but most prominently, vision, language, memory, and decision making - at the computational and algorithmic levels. I might not have the time to do them all in my lifetime but I am happy to learn about them any time :). From a methodology perspective, I am interested in computational
modeling (perceptual modeling with ANNs, multi-region modeling) and deep
probabilistic generative models (DiT, identifiable VAE).
